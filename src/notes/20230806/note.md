# Delay

## First attempt

- Take fastest delay to be 16ps per cell (ff, 2.0V, 0C)
- Take slowest delay to be 77ps per cell (ss, 1.4V, 0C)
- To meet 20ns 
   
   - 260 cells for slow
   - 1250 cells for fast

- Too many cells

## Second attempt

- Assume delay line will be slow than indivudal part test
 
- Take fastest delay to be 25ps per cell (ff, 1.8V, 0C)
- Take slowest delay to be 49ps per cell (ss, 1.6V, 0C)

- To meet 20ns 
   
   - 408 cells for slow
   - 800 cells for fast

- This would be a flop every 12.5 inverters ...

## Third

- Attempt to tune by building and testing at corners
